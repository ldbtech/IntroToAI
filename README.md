# IntroToAI

There are three documents in here:
First one which is intro to python and data analytics. Where we learned how to use numpy and pandas, matplotlib.
Second one was about implementing BFS and DFS Algorithms to find shortest path. 
Third one was about building RL models (Q-Learninng and Sarsa Algorithms) using OpenGYM for interface.
